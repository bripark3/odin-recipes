<h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>Combine 1 cup potato starch, salt,and vegetable oil in a bowl.
          Add a splash of boiling water at a time, stirring between
          additions, until you get a perfectly textured dough.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer to a work surface dusted with a little potato starch.
          Working quickly while the dough is still warm, knead, adding 
          more potato starch if necessary, until smooth and elastic.
      </li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Set out
          a large bowl of cold water.
          </li>
      <li>While the water is boiling roll dogh to a thickness of 1/8 inch.
          Cut into 1/4 inch noodles with a pizza cutter. Seperate noodles
      </li>
      <li>Add potato noodles and cook until they float, about 1 minute. Transfer 
          to the bowl of cold water. Repeat to cook remaining noodles.
      </li>
      <li>whisk oyster sauce, soy sauce, rice vinegar, ketchup, sesame oil,
          sugar, and sriracha together in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add Garlic
          and sizzle for 15 seconds. Add 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes and green onions; 
          stir-fry for just a few seconds. Before the garlic starts to brown
          add in the potato noodles. Its okay that some water comes into the
          pan as it will stop the cooking process and prevent the garlic
          from burning
          <li>Add sauce and stir until noodles are coated. Cook until noodles
              are heated through and sauce starts to simmer, 1 to 2 minutes.

          </li>
