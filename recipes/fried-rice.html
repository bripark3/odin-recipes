          <li>1/2 cup soy sauce, or to taste</li>
      </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
      <ol>
          <li>Bring water to a boil in a saucepan.
              Stir instant white rice into boiling water.
              Cook rice until softened, about 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Heat oil in a seperate skillet over medium heat. Cook
              chicken in hot oil until cooked through and no longer
              pink in the middle, 5 to 7 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Fry bacon in a large wok or skillet over medium-high until
              hot and cooked through, but not yet crunchy. 2 to 3 minutes per side.
              Remove bacon to a plate lined with a paper towel. Drain fat from wok
              reserving 1 to 2 tablespoons of drippings in the wok. Cut bacon 
              into small pieces.
          </li>
          <li>Return wok to medium-high heat and heat bacon drippings. Combine
              rice,chicken,bacon,green onions, and soy sauce in wok; cook and stir
              until evenly mixed and hot, 2 to 3 minutes.
